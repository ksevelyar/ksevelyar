üëã  I'm a self-taught functional programmer and [Linux](https://github.com/ksevelyar/idempotent-desktop) enthusiast.\
Elixir and Rust are my [learning](https://exercism.org/profiles/ksevelyar/solutions) priorities for the moment.

üíº I do web development with Phoenix/Vue as [software architect](mailto:ksevelyar@protonmail.com) with my [friends](https://github.com/rusty-cluster). 
* Ruby on Rails -> Phoenix
* Docker -> Nix
* jQuery -> vanilla JS -> [Vue](https://github.com/rusty-cluster/styleguide/blob/main/js/vue.md)
* Bootstrap -> Bulma -> [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) + CSS Grid
* SASS -> PostCSS + SugarSS

Phoenix.LiveView is overhyped thing for me, because it moves computation from browser to back-end. It [can't work offline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) too. \
It's a lot cheaper for business to split front-end and back-end to separate git repos and hire regular Vue/Elm/Svelte developers for the front-end. 

[GraphQL subscribers](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe) are more appealing to my flow, to pass reactivity from back-end to front-end.

üñ®Ô∏è I have an Ender 3 with [several upgrades](https://github.com/ksevelyar/fishing-for-fishies). I create [simple models](https://github.com/ksevelyar/mini-itx-case) with Openscad and want to switch to much faster, but also much less documented libfive.
