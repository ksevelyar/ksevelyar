üëã  I'm a self-taught functional programmer and [Linux](https://github.com/ksevelyar/idempotent-desktop) enthusiast.\
Elixir and Rust are my [learning](https://exercism.org/profiles/ksevelyar/solutions) priorities for the moment.

üíº I do web development with Phoenix/Vue on [freelance](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010c740b3ae988f745). 
* Ruby on Rails -> Phoenix 
* jQuery -> vanilla JS -> Vue
* Bootstrap -> Bulma -> [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) + CSS Grid

I don't like Phoenix.LiveView, because it moves computation from browser to back-end. GraphQL subscribers more appealing for me.

üñ®Ô∏è I have an Ender 3 with several upgrades: SKR 1.4 + TMC2209 + [Marlin](https://github.com/ksevelyar/fishing-for-fishies), 3DTouch, a glass bed, Sunon maglev fans, connected to Orange Pi Zero2 which hosts OctoPrint. I create [simple models](https://github.com/ksevelyar/mini-itx-case) with Openscad and want to switch to much faster, but also much less documented libfive.
