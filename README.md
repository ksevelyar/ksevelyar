üëã  I'm a self-taught functional programmer and [Linux](https://github.com/ksevelyar/idempotent-desktop) enthusiast.\
Elixir and Rust are my [learning](https://exercism.org/profiles/ksevelyar/solutions) priorities for the moment.

üíº I do web development with Phoenix/Vue as [software architect](mailto:ksevelyar@protonmail.com) with my [friends](https://github.com/rusty-cluster). 
* Ruby on Rails -> Phoenix
* Docker -> Nix
* jQuery -> vanilla JS -> [Vue](https://github.com/rusty-cluster/styleguide/blob/main/js/vue.md)
* Bootstrap -> Bulma -> [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) + CSS Grid
* SASS -> PostCSS + SugarSS

I don't like Phoenix.LiveView, because it moves computation from browser to back-end. GraphQL subscribers are more appealing to me.

üñ®Ô∏è I have an Ender 3 with [several upgrades](https://github.com/ksevelyar/fishing-for-fishies). I create [simple models](https://github.com/ksevelyar/mini-itx-case) with Openscad and want to switch to much faster, but also much less documented libfive.
