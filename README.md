üëã  I'm a self-taught functional programmer and [Linux](https://github.com/ksevelyar/idempotent-desktop) enthusiast.\
Elixir and Rust are my [learning](https://exercism.org/profiles/ksevelyar/solutions) priorities for the moment. 

‚òÆÔ∏è I feel sorry to pay taxes to Putin and his [bandits](https://youtu.be/ibqiet6Bg38). 
Putin lies so sloppily you need a bang operator to get the truth: Putin's government is the Ministry of Truth from 1984.
Putin & Co usurped the power in 1997. His narcissistic personality disorder evolved each year since 2000. He, his friends, and pet oligarchs deserve a war tribunal. 

üíº I do web development with Phoenix/Vue on [freelance](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010c740b3ae988f745). 
* Ruby on Rails -> Phoenix
* Docker -> Nix
* jQuery -> vanilla JS -> Vue
* Bootstrap -> Bulma -> [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) + CSS Grid
* SASS -> PostCSS + SugarSS

I don't like Phoenix.LiveView, because it moves computation from browser to back-end. GraphQL subscribers are more appealing to me.

üñ®Ô∏è I have an Ender 3 with [several upgrades](https://github.com/ksevelyar/fishing-for-fishies). I create [simple models](https://github.com/ksevelyar/mini-itx-case) with Openscad and want to switch to much faster, but also much less documented libfive.
